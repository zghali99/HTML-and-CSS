		<p>As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Lattitude). More interestingly, however, is the 
		fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the norhtern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth 
		at the time of the year this data was gathered.</p>
